## Properties

Properties in C# provide a way for classes to expose data while controlling access to it, encapsulating logic for getting and setting values.

### 1. Properties Basic Example

Properties allow us to define how data is accessed and modified outside the class, providing a clean interface for interacting with private fields.

### 2. Required Properties

Properties can be required to have both `get` and `set` accessors, ensuring they support both reading and writing values.

### 3. Static Property

Static properties belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class, accessed using the class name.

### 4. Virtual Property

Virtual properties allow derived classes to override the property behavior, enabling polymorphic behavior.

### 5. Abstract Property

Abstract properties are declared in abstract classes or interfaces without implementation, requiring derived classes to provide implementations.

### 6. Interface Property

Interface properties declare a contract in interfaces that implementing classes must adhere to.

### 7. Hidden Property

Hidden properties in derived classes introduce a new property with the same name as a base class's property but with different behavior.
